    "This lab is focused on the fundamentals of Python and working with raw data, specifically in the context of DNA sequences. Here's a breakdown of what you're expected to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA is composed of four bases: A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine). These are the \"letters\" of the DNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to process this DNA data and extract useful information from it using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of the Lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: You'll be given a text file (dna_raw.txt) that contains several DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of each sequence is an identifier (sequence ID) that starts with a > symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line contains the actual DNA sequence (a string of A, T, C, G).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: For each sequence, you'll count the occurrences of each DNA letter (A, T, C, G) and graph the frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the File:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to read the DNA sequences from a file (dna_raw.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "The file will have multiple sequences. Each sequence has two lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 1: Sequence ID (it starts with a > symbol).\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 2: The DNA sequence itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Count the DNA Bases:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each sequence, you need to count how many times each base (A, T, C, G) appears in the DNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case-insensitive: This means you should treat lowercase and uppercase letters as the same (i.e., \"a\" = \"A\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Store Results in a Dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each DNA sequence, you'll store the counts of each base in a dictionary. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'A': 120,\n",
    "  'T': 115,\n",
    "  'C': 100,\n",
    "  'G': 105\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph the Frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll create a graph (like a bar chart) to visually represent the frequency of each DNA letter for each sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done using libraries like matplotlib in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of the Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose dna_raw.txt contains:\n",
    "\n",
    ">seq1\n",
    "ATCGATCG\n",
    ">seq2\n",
    "GGGCCCATTAGG\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For seq1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Count occurrences of A, T, C, and G:\n",
    "\n",
    "A: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "T: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "C: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "G: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary: {'A': 2, 'T': 2, 'C': 2, 'G': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "For seq2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Count occurrences of A, T, C, and G:\n",
    "\n",
    "A: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "T: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "C: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "G: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary: {'A': 1, 'T': 2, 'C': 3, 'G': 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "You will repeat this process for all the sequences in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Concepts Youâ€™ll Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "File Handling: To read data from dna_raw.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries: To store the counts of DNA letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops: To iterate over each sequence and count the bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization: Using libraries like matplotlib to graph the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is This Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Application: In fields like bioinformatics, data scientists often work with DNA data to understand genetic information. This task mimics a real-world scenario where you need to analyze and visualize genetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Processing: The lab helps you practice working with raw data and transforming it into a useful format (counts and graphs) that can be analyzed further.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read DNA sequences from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Count the occurrences of each DNA base (A, T, C, G) for each sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Store the counts in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph the frequency of the DNA bases."
